 * Music style sets each line past the active one off [AppleMusicMotion.STAGGER_S] after the one
 * before it, up to [AppleMusicMotion.STAGGER_STEPS] lines, like a CSS transition delay.
 *
 * The lines' own shifts (a background vocal folding or an interlude opening) are kept with each
 * position: a fold above the active line moves every line below it as the scroll makes up for it,
 * so a late line has to take both from the same moment or it jumps ahead and back.
